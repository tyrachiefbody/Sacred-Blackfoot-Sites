            <p class="paragraph-style">The Sweet Grass Hills are located in North Central Montana, north of Highway 2, right near the Canadian border. The Sweet Grass Hills consist of three distinct buttes with scattered grassy hills connecting them. The three buttes are West Butte (elevation of 6983 feet), Gold Butte (elevation of 6512 feet) and East Butte (elevation of 6958 feet). The three buttes and the hills between them run for about 50 miles east to west and are about 10 miles in distance from north to south.

            <h3>Cultural significance</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-style">The Sweetgrass Hills are part of the Blackfoot’s creation story, and there are other legends of the sweetgrass hills that are told by our ancestors that were passed down through the generations. The site has been used in cultural practices since time immemorial. There’s a cave there with sacred artifacts within that cave. People were told by ancestors to never go into that certain cave because of the sacredness of it.
                There are three distinct buttes that make up the Sweetgrass Hills. For hunting parties in the past, that was another area they would go to prepare. They would also go there for vision quests. Till this day people go there to make offerings.

            <h3>Katoyissa (Blood Clot)</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-style">An old couple camped with their son-in-law who was married to three of their daughters. The son-in-law was very cruel. He made the old man chase buffalo for him but did not share the food with the old couple. Only the youngest daughter helped the old couple and took food to their lodge.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-style">One day the old man found a clot of blood on the prairie. He hid it from his son-in-law and took it to his wife, telling her to cook it in a soup. As the water boiled the old couple heard a baby crying. Looking into the pot, they saw a child who instructed them to take him out and hold him up to each pole in the lodge. As the old couple did so the child grew and became a young man named Katoyissa, or Blood Clot. After hearing the old people's story, Katoyissa devised a plan to kill the son-in-law and the daughters who did not help their parents. </p>
            <p class="paragraph-style">Once he saved the old couple, Katoyissa travelled throughout our territory, saving our people from various evil beings who kept them captive. When Katoyissa was finished, our people were free to travel throughout the territory Ihtsipaitapiyopa (the Creator) had given them. The world was now safe for our people.We believe that Katoyissa now sleeps at the place called the Sweet Grass Hills, although we call them Katoyissiksi, the Sweet Pine Hills.</p>
