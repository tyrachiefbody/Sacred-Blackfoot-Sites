                <p class="paragraph-style">Áísínai'pi National Historic Site of Canada, also known as Writing-on-Stone
                    Provincial Park, is located on the Milk River in southern Alberta 150 km east of the Rocky
                    Mountains.
                    Set in a region of rolling mixed grass-prairie near the northern limits of the Great Plains, the
                    Milk
                    River and its tributaries are deeply incised into the surrounding grassland creating dramatic
                    vertical
                    sandstone cliffs above and overlooking the river. The sandstone cliffs, caves and hoodoos are the
                    canvas
                    for extensive rock art that consist of carvings (petroglyphs) and paintings (pictographs) that
                    commemorate vision quests and record significant events of the Niitsítapi or Blackfoot from
                    approximately 4000 BCE until the early 20th century. The site provides spectacular views of the
                    Poyíítahtai valley and the surrounding landscape. Official recognition refers to the land
                    circumscribed
                    by the boundaries of Writing-on-Stone Provincial Park, which comprises 1718 hectares, with its many
                    archaeological and rock art sites.

                            class="image-dec"></div>

                <h3>Cultural significance</h3>
                <p class="paragraph-style">The Blackfoot have, for more than 8,000 years, revered it as a sacred site
                    and as
                    a safe place for passage through that area. If the Blackfoot were going to war parties or horse
                    raiding
                    parties, they would stop at Writing-onStone for safe passage, so it has always been a place regarded
                    as
                    a sacred site by the Blackfoot. It’s also a place for vision quests, ceremonies, and a place to do
                    our
                    offerings as well. There are many Blackfoot legends that tell stories of the sacredness of the land.
                    It's been known to us blackfoot people that very powerful spirits are still there. If anyone has
                    been to
                    writing-on-stone, especially for the Blackfoot people, and we see the writings, it's such a
                    connection
                    to our history such a connection to that ceremonial past that we have.
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph-style">In Blackfoot traditions, the world around us is the work of Náápi who gained
                    his powers from the Creator.
                    Náápi did a wonderful job making the land. Special places like Writing-on-Stone / Áísínai'pi are
                    here
                    for a reason. This is where significant things happened to the ancestors of the Blackfoot. This is
                    where
                    the ancient stories took place.</p>
